# encapsulation - bundle related attributes and behaviours for better organization and change management.
# restrict - restrict certain attribute and method for security.
# provide abstraction by hiding internal algorithms and data representation by exposing the required detail with consistent interface.

# Public - accessible anywhere i.e. inside or outside the class.
# Private - accessible only within a class.  define using Leading double underscore (__). can be made available to outside world using public methods.
# Protected - used to provide the access in subclasses and reuse them. single underscore (_) is used to define the member with protected access.
# protected is not enforced by python and used as a convention (Rule)

# Name mageling - In Python, private attributes (starting with __) are not truly privateâ€”they are only name-mangled to avoid accidental conflicts in subclasses.
# Without name mangling, a subclass could unintentionally override a private attribute from its parent class, leading to unexpected behavior.
# Python internally renames __data in Parent to _Parent__data and __data in Child to _Child__data. This prevents unintended conflicts.
# Syntax: obj._<classname>__<attribute>
# it is also used to access private memebers outside the class using obj of child. eg obj._<classname>__<attribute>. but it is not recommended
# # we can override the public and protected attributes though.
