## Facade:
- Scenario: The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface for clients (user, system, or service) to interact with a complex subsystem while managing object instantiation and lifecycle.

- Benefit: It hides complexity, centralizes object creation and management, improves usability, and promotes loose coupling.

## Adapter: 
- Scenario: Use the Adapter Pattern when integrating a third-party library or legacy system with an incompatible interface into an existing application.

- Benefit: It decouples the client from the external system, allowing seamless communication without modifying either, ensuring flexibility and maintainability.
